# Elm jobs
Discuss and post jobs for Elm. Publish the jobs via issue on Github.

See available jobs in: [https://github.com/FidelisClayton/elm-jobs/issues](https://github.com/FidelisClayton/elm-jobs/issues)

## Motivations and Inspirations
The elm lang slack already has a channel to post Elm jobs and already have some pinned, so, why do I've created this repository?

Some points:
- Slack pins doesn't have a good usability
- It's not easy to search and navigate by those pins
- Slack has a limited history (on free plan)
- Github issues are much easier to search, filter, manage and discuss.

This repository was inspired by [frontendbr/vagas](https://github.com/frontendbr/vagas/issues).

## Posting a job
Open a new **issue**, at the issue title put the city name and country between square brackets followed by the job title.

e.g: `[SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil] Elm Front-End Developer`

Add the necessary labels to facilitate the search (required level, remote...).

## Important
If the job is not more available please close the issue to prevent new job applies.
